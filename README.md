### Bodega 


This app is an experiment in using Coinbase's Smart Contract Wallet for 
real world in-person purchase experiences. 

You can use it on https://alexcusack.github.io/scw-sample/. 

Right now it only interacts with Base Sepolia. 

### Dev notes 

The app relies on only the Coinbase Wallet SDK (no wagmi, viem, web3, or ether.js etc.).
There's are no backend components and it lives entirely on Github pages. 

Serverless payment processing demonstrates the permissionless nature of blockchains as a public good.
